# bus-mall survey
Lab 11 BusMall project

PURPOSE: Busmall wants an app to display potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side) where the focus groups choose which product of the displayed three images that they would most likely purchase, and then store, calculate and visually display the results with a total of 25 selections. Their marketing team would also like data on how many were viewed and clicked. Created local storage.
